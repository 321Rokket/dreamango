## 3. Environment Configuration

### 3.1. Cloud Resource Provisioning & IaC

*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Strongly recommend using IaC tools (e.g., Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation, Azure Bicep) to define and manage cloud infrastructure reproducibly and under version control.
*   **Cloud Environment Setup:**
    *   Install and configure necessary cloud provider CLI tools (e.g., `gcloud`, `aws cli`, `az cli`).
    *   Authenticate to the cloud provider with appropriate credentials.
    *   Set up or select the target project, account, or subscription.
    *   Enable all required cloud provider APIs and services (e.g., for container runtimes, build services, container registries, managed databases, secret management).
*   **Key Managed Services (Examples - select based on chosen provider and needs):**
    *   Compute/Runtime: Kubernetes services (e.g., GKE, EKS, AKS), Serverless container platforms (e.g., Cloud Run, App Runner, Azure Container Apps), Functions-as-a-Service (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions).
    *   Database: Managed relational databases (e.g., Cloud SQL, RDS, Azure SQL Database), NoSQL databases.
    *   Container Registry: For storing Docker/OCI images (e.g., GCR, ECR, ACR).
    *   Secret Management: Dedicated services for secure storage and access to secrets (e.g., Google Secret Manager, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).

### 3.2. Environment Specifics

| Aspect | Development | Staging | Production | Notes |
|--------|---------------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| Purpose | Feature testing, debugging | UAT, pre-prod validation | Live user access |  |
| Data | Synthetic, anonymized | Anonymized copy of prod (subset) | Live user data | Data isolation is key |
| Resources | Minimal, cost-effective | Scaled-down prod-like | Scaled for peak load, resilient |  |
| Auto-Deploy | Yes (on push to `develop` / feature branches) | Typically manual approval | Strictly manual, controlled |  |
| Monitoring Level | Basic | Comprehensive | Full, with alerting |  |
| Access Control | Developer team | QA, stakeholders | End-users, ops team |  |

## 4. Deployment Process

### 4.1. Standard Deployment (for [Component Type])

1.  Ensure all items in **Section 1 (Deployment Readiness Assessment)** are green for the target environment.
2.  Merge changes to the appropriate branch (`develop` for dev/staging, `main` for production via PR).
3.  CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) executes automatically:
    *   Runs all checks (linting, tests, security scans).
    *   Builds and versions artifacts (e.g., Rust crate, binaries, Docker image).
    *   Publishes artifacts to the appropriate registry/storage.
4.  Deployment to Environment:
    *   May involve scripted sequences of cloud provider CLI commands, ideally orchestrated via IaC tools or dedicated CI/CD pipeline steps.
    *   **Development:** Often automated post-artifact push.
    *   **Staging:** Manual trigger/approval using the versioned artifact from CI.
    *   **Production:** Manual trigger/approval, potentially with phased rollout (e.g., canary, blue/green for web services).
5.  Execute **Section 6 (Post-Deployment Verification)**.
6.  Monitor **Section 7 (Monitoring & Alerting)** dashboards.

### 4.2. Hotfix Deployment (for [Component Type])

1.  Create hotfix branch from `main` (e.g., `hotfix/issue-123`).
2.  Implement fix with comprehensive tests verifying the fix and non-regression.
3.  Create PR to `main` with detailed explanation of the issue and fix.
4.  Obtain expedited review (minimum 2 reviewers, including tech lead).
5.  Ensure CI/CD pipeline passes for the hotfix branch.
6.  Merge to `main` and deploy to Production with heightened monitoring.
7.  Cherry-pick/merge fix back to `develop` branch.

## 5. Rollback Procedures

### 5.1. Quick Rollback (Application Issue - [Component Type])

1.  Identify previous stable version/artifact (e.g., Git tag, Docker image tag, crate version).
2.  Trigger deployment of the previous stable version to the affected environment.
3.  Verify system stability via health checks and critical path tests.
4.  Document the incident, root cause, and resolution.

### 5.2. Database Rollback (Primarily for Phase 4 Web Backend)

*This is a critical and complex operation. Prefer to fix forward if possible.*
1.  If automated backups are in place, identify the last known good backup before the problematic migration.
2.  Restore the database to a new instance from the backup.
3.  If point-in-time recovery (PITR) is available and necessary, apply WAL logs up to the point before the faulty migration.
4.  Re-point the application to the restored database instance.
5.  Thoroughly verify data integrity and application functionality.
6.  Document the incident extensively.

## 6. Post-Deployment Verification

| Authentication/Authorization (Services, GUI with accounts) | ⬜ | Login, token validation, permission checks |
| Basic CLI Command Execution | ⬜ | `--version`, `--help`, sample commands |
| GUI Startup & Core Interaction | ⬜ | Application launches, main views render |
| Scheduled Tasks / Cron Jobs (if any) | ⬜ | Verify execution and success |

### 6.2. Manual Verification (Exploratory & Use-Case Based)

| Check | Status | Notes (Component Specific) |
|-------|--------|----------------------------|
| Critical User Flows Tested | ⬜ | Registration, core simulation setup, data output (as applicable) |
