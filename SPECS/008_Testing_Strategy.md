## I. Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy and coding best practices adopted within the DreamAngo project. The goal is to ensure high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software through a multi-layered testing approach and adherence to established coding standards.

## II. Testing Strategy & Tools

The project employs a comprehensive testing strategy covering backend, frontend, and integration aspects.

### 1. Backend Testing (Python/Django)
*   **Primary Tools:**
    *   `pytest`: The main test runner, valued for its simplicity and extensive plugin support.
    *   `pytest-django`: Facilitates seamless integration with Django, simplifying the testing of Django-specific components like models, views, and ORM interactions.
    *   `pytest-cov`: Used for measuring code coverage, ensuring that tests adequately cover the application logic.
*   **Key Practices:**
    *   **Unit Tests:** Focus on testing individual functions, methods, and classes in isolation.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Verify interactions between different backend components (e.g., service layers, database interactions).
    *   **API Endpoint Testing:** Ensure RESTful APIs behave as expected, validating request handling, response codes, and data formats.
    *   Test execution and coverage reporting are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.

### 2. Frontend Testing (React/TypeScript)
*   **Primary Tools:**
    *   `Jest`: A widely-used JavaScript testing framework, particularly well-suited for React applications.
    *   `React Testing Library`: Encourages testing components based on user interaction and behavior, rather than internal implementation details.
    *   `TypeScript`: Leveraged for static type checking, which helps catch type-related errors during development.
*   **Key Practices:**
    *   **Component Tests:** Verify that individual React components render correctly and respond appropriately to user interactions.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Test interactions between multiple components or components with state management (e.g., Redux, Context API).
    *   Test execution and coverage reporting are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.

### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing
*   **Status:** Area for future enhancement.
*   **Recommendation:** Implement E2E tests using tools like Cypress or Playwright to simulate complete user flows across the application (frontend to backend). This will provide an additional layer of confidence in the overall system integrity.

## III. Coding Standards & Best Practices

Maintaining high code quality is paramount. The project enforces the following standards:

### 1. Backend (Python/Django)
*   **Linters & Formatters:**
    *   `flake8`: Checks for PEP 8 compliance, logical errors (e.g., undefined names), and code complexity.
    *   `black`: An opinionated code formatter ensuring a consistent and readable code style.
    *   `mypy`: A static type checker for Python, used to identify type errors before runtime.
*   **Key Practices:**
    *   Strict adherence to PEP 8 style guidelines.
    *   Consistent code formatting automatically enforced by `black` (often via pre-commit hooks or CI checks).
    *   Comprehensive use of Python type hints to improve code clarity and enable static analysis.
    *   Automated linting, formatting, and type checking are part of the CI/CD pipeline.

### 2. Frontend (React/TypeScript)
*   **Linters & Formatters:**
    *   `ESLint`: A highly configurable linter for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript and TypeScript code.
    *   `Prettier`: An opinionated code formatter that ensures a consistent style across the frontend codebase.
*   **Key Practices:**
    *   Adherence to established best practices for React and TypeScript development.
    *   Consistent code formatting enforced by `Prettier`.
    *   Leveraging TypeScript's static typing features to catch errors early.
    *   Automated linting and formatting are part of the CI/CD pipeline.

### 3. General Best Practices
*   **Environment Management:**
    *   Backend: `conda` for Python environments; `python-decouple` for secure management of environment variables from `.env` files.
    *   Frontend: `npm` for Node.js package and dependency management.
*   **Version Control (Git):**
    *   Standardized branching strategy: `main` (production), `staging`, `develop`, and feature branches (e.g., `feature/your-feature`).
    *   Adherence to Conventional Commits format for clear, descriptive, and consistent commit messages.
*   **Security:**
    *   Isolation of environment-specific configurations and secrets.
    *   Use of Google Secret Manager for production secrets.
    *   Enforcement of HTTPS.
    *   Implementation of input validation and other standard security measures.
*   **Containerization (Docker):**
    *   Consistent development and deployment environments using Docker and `docker-compose.yml`.
    *   Multi-stage Docker builds to create optimized, smaller production images.
*   **CI/CD (GitHub Actions):**
    *   Fully automated pipeline for testing (unit, integration, coverage), linting, formatting, and type checking.
    *   Automated deployments to Google Cloud Run for staging and production environments upon merges to respective branches.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Comprehensive project documentation maintained within the `SPECS/` directory, covering architecture, deployment procedures, local development setup, and project progress (Kanban, checklists).

## IV. CI/CD Integration

*   **Workflow:** Defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
*   **Backend Pipeline Steps:** Checkout -> Setup Python -> Install Dependencies -> Lint (Flake8) -> Format (Black) -> Run Tests with Coverage (pytest, pytest-cov) -> Upload Coverage (Codecov).
*   **Frontend Pipeline Steps:** Checkout -> Setup Node -> Install Dependencies -> Lint (ESLint) -> Format (Prettier) -> Run Tests with Coverage (Jest) -> Build.
*   **Deployment:** Automated deployment to GCP Cloud Run for `develop` (staging) and `main` (production) branches.
*   **Reporting:** Test results and coverage reports are generated and can be reviewed (e.g., Codecov for backend coverage).

## V. Code Coverage Goals

*   **Target:** Aim for a minimum of 80-85% code coverage for both backend and frontend.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly review coverage reports generated by `pytest-cov` (backend) and Jest (frontend) via Codecov or similar tools integrated into the CI pipeline.

## VI. Test Data Management

*   **Strategy:** For backend tests requiring database interaction, utilize Django's testing utilities for creating test databases and managing test data (e.g., fixtures, factory libraries like `factory_boy`).
*   **Frontend:** Mock external dependencies and API calls using Jest's mocking capabilities.

## VII. Current State & Areas for Future Enhancement

*   **Test Coverage Review:** Continuously monitor and strive to improve code coverage, particularly for critical business logic and complex components.
*   **E2E Testing:** Prioritize the implementation of E2E tests to validate full user workflows.
*   **Performance Testing:** Introduce performance and load testing for critical API endpoints and user interactions as the application scales.
*   **Security Testing:** Explore incorporating Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools or periodic penetration testing.
*   **Test Documentation:** Ensure test cases are clearly named and complex tests include comments explaining their purpose and logic.

This strategy provides a robust framework for ensuring the quality and reliability of the DreamAngo platform.
