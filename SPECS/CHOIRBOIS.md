## System Overview

CHOIRBOIS is a hierarchical multi-agent system that orchestrates end-to-end software development, testing, deployment, and operations through a conductor-performer model inspired by musical orchestration.

### Core Principles
1. **Human-Centered**: Human remains the ultimate conductor with AI agents as intelligent performers
2. **Hierarchical Intelligence**: Decision-making flows from Super-Conductors down to Nano-Conductors
3. **Collaborative Execution**: Multiple AI sources (local, API, tools) work in harmony
4. **Continuous Orchestration**: Real-time adaptation and feedback loops
5. **Cross-Platform Integration**: Unified workflow across all development tools

# CHOIRBOIS Conductor Roles - Deep Dive Analysis

## Hierarchical Intelligence Design

### The Musical Metaphor Applied
Just as a symphony orchestra has a conductor who coordinates different sections (strings, brass, woodwinds, percussion), CHOIRBOIS uses a hierarchical conductor system where:

- **Super-Conductors** = Principal Conductor (strategic vision, overall coordination)
- **Conductors** = Section Leaders (violins, brass section leaders)  
- **Semi-Conductors** = Subsection Leaders (first chair positions)
- **Micro-Conductors** = Individual virtuoso players
- **Nano-Conductors** = Technical specialists (tuning, timing, specific techniques)
