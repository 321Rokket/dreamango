## II. Key File Modifications & Achievements Today:

### 1. Deployment Script (`deploy.sh`)
*   **Last Modified:** 2025-05-22 (by USER)
*   **Changes Summary:**
    *   Updated `gcloud run deploy` commands for both `dreamango-backend` and `dreamango-frontend` services.
    *   Ensured secrets (e.g., `DREAMANGO_SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS`) are correctly passed to Cloud Run by appending `:latest` to the secret names (e.g., `DREAMANGO_SECRET_KEY=DREAMANGO_SECRET_KEY:latest`). This ensures the latest version of each secret is utilized by the services.
