## Project Overview

The HEDIS Measure Engine & Analytics Platform is a Python-based system for calculating HEDIS measures and providing healthcare analytics. It utilizes Pydantic for data modeling, FastAPI for its API, and a custom engine for measure calculations. The platform aims for accuracy, maintainability, and adherence to NCQA HEDIS MY2025 specifications.
