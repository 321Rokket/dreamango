## 1. Project Overview

DreamCatchr (codename: Dreamango) is a full-stack commercial intelligence platform built with Django REST Framework backend and React TypeScript frontend, deployed on Google Cloud Run. The platform is designed to provide business intelligence and analytics capabilities.

## 2. Production Deployment Status

### ✅ LIVE PRODUCTION URLS
- **Frontend (Public):** https://dreamango-frontend-108538800485.us-central1.run.app
- **Backend (Private):** https://dreamango-backend-108538800485.us-central1.run.app
- **Health Check:** https://dreamango-backend-108538800485.us-central1.run.app/health/
- **API Status:** https://dreamango-backend-108538800485.us-central1.run.app/api/status/

### ✅ Architecture Completed
- **Backend**: Django 5.2+ with DRF, gunicorn, SQLite (PostgreSQL ready)
- **Frontend**: React 19.1 + TypeScript 5.8 + Vite 6.3, Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI
- **Infrastructure**: Google Cloud Run with proper security configuration
- **Database**: SQLite for development, Cloud SQL ready for production
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with staging/production deployment pipelines

## 3. Recent Achievements (May 23, 2025)

### ✅ Complete Deployment Pipeline
- Fixed all Docker configuration issues (port mismatches, nginx config)
- Resolved Django security settings for Cloud Run deployment
- Added health check endpoints for load balancers
- Implemented CSRF exemption for API endpoints
- Updated CI/CD pipeline for staging and production environments

### ✅ Infrastructure as Code
- Complete Terraform configuration for Cloud Run services
- Service account setup with least-privilege permissions
- Secret Manager integration for secure configuration
- Organization policy management for public access

### ✅ Security Implementation
- Resolved all GitHub-detected security vulnerabilities
- Updated dependencies (Gunicorn 23.0.0, DjangoRestFramework 3.16.0)
- Removed vulnerable temporary files from repository
- Implemented proper authentication model (public frontend, private backend)

### ✅ Documentation & DevOps
- Comprehensive deployment documentation (GCP_SECURITY_SETUP.md)
- Updated project documentation (README.md, CLAUDE.md)
- Deployment checklist and status tracking
- Git workflow with proper branch management

## 4. Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Configuration
```
- Port: 8000 (standardized)
- Health endpoints: /health/ and /api/status/
- CSRF exemption for health checks
- Environment-based security settings
- SQLite default with PostgreSQL fallback
```

### Frontend Configuration
```
- Nginx proxy configuration with proper env vars
- Public access via Cloud Run
- Backend API proxy configuration
- Static asset caching and compression
```

### Infrastructure
```
- Cloud Run services with auto-scaling
- Service accounts with minimal permissions
- Environment variable configuration
- Public frontend, private backend architecture
```

## 5. Current Operational Status

### ✅ Fully Operational
- Frontend accessible to all users without authentication
- Backend API responding correctly to authenticated requests
- Health checks passing
- CI/CD pipeline functional for future deployments
- Repository up-to-date with all deployment configurations

### Security Status
- Organization policy compliance achieved
- No active security vulnerabilities
- Proper secret management in place
- DevSecOps best practices implemented

## 6. Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate (Ready for Production Use)
- ✅ Application is live and ready for users
- ✅ Monitoring and logging via Cloud Run built-in tools
- ✅ Scalable infrastructure configuration

### Future Enhancements
1. **Database Migration**: Migrate from SQLite to Cloud SQL PostgreSQL for production data
2. **Custom Domain**: Configure custom domain with SSL certificates
3. **Advanced Monitoring**: Implement Cloud Monitoring and alerting
4. **API Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting for production API usage
5. **Content Delivery**: Consider CDN integration for static assets

## 7. Development Workflow

### Deployment Process
```bash
# Manual deployment
./deploy.sh

# CI/CD triggers
git push origin main        # → Production deployment
git push origin staging     # → Staging deployment
```

### Local Development
```bash
# Docker development
docker-compose up --build

# Direct development
cd backend && python manage.py runserver 8000
cd frontend && npm run dev
```
