## 1. Project Overview

The HEDIS Measure Engine & Analytics Platform is a Python-based system designed to ingest healthcare data, calculate HEDIS (Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set) measures, and provide analytics capabilities. The project leverages Pydantic for robust data modeling and validation, FastAPI for building a performant API layer, and a custom-developed engine for HEDIS measure calculations. The goal is to create a flexible, accurate, and maintainable platform for health quality reporting and improvement.

Key goals include:
- Accurate implementation of HEDIS MY2025 measure specifications.
- Scalable data ingestion and processing pipelines.
- A comprehensive rules engine for eligibility and calculation logic, defined in `hedis_platform/app/models/framework_models.py`.
- An API for data submission, calculation triggering, and results retrieval.
- A phased development plan as outlined in the project roadmap.

For more details, see:
- [`SPECS/001_VISION.md`](./001_VISION.md)
- [`SPECS/000_PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`](./000_PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md)
- [`SPECS/000_PROJECT_ROADMAP.md`](./000_PROJECT_ROADMAP.md)

## 2. Codebase Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **Root (`/`)**:
    - `hedis_platform/`: Main application package.
        - `app/`: Core application logic.
            - `models/`: Pydantic models, including `framework_models.py` (defines `HealthMeasureType`, rules engine, etc.) and `ratings_framework_models.py` (defines `PrimitiveType`, `DomainSpecificItem`, `RatingsFrameworkDefinition` for a generalized ratings/metrics system).
            - `api/`: FastAPI application and endpoints (planned, directory not yet created).
            - `engine/`: HEDIS measure calculation logic (in development, directory not yet created).
        - `utils/`: Utility scripts, including `hedis_measure_parser.py`.
    - `scripts/`: Standalone utility scripts (currently empty, can be used for ad-hoc tasks).
    - `SPECS/`: Contains all project specification, planning, vision, and documentation files.
        - `info_docs/`: Supporting documents, including HEDIS measure descriptions and parsed outputs.
            - `HEDIS-MY-2025-Measure-Description.txt`: Source text for HEDIS measures.
            - `parsed_hedis_measures_my2025.json`: JSON output of parsed HEDIS measures.
            - `HEDIS-MY-2025-Measure-Description.md`: (Currently has a pandoc conversion error).
    - `tests/`: Unit and integration tests.
    - `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`: Project dependencies.
    - Configuration files: `.gitignore`, etc.

## 3. Recent Activities

- **Pydantic Model Development (`framework_models.py`)**:
    - Successfully created and validated comprehensive Pydantic models for the core framework, including `HealthMeasureType`, `HealthMeasureCategory`, and a detailed rules engine (Conditions, Rules, EligibilityRuleSet, MeasureCalculationLogic).
    - `HealthMeasureType` now incorporates `eligibility_rules` and `calculation_logic` fields.
- **Ratings Framework Model Development (`ratings_framework_models.py`)**:
    - Initiated development of a generalized ratings framework using a TDD approach.
    - Implemented `PrimitiveType`, `DomainSpecificItem`, and `RatingsFrameworkDefinition` Pydantic models in `hedis_platform/app/models/ratings_framework_models.py`.
    - Developed comprehensive unit tests for these models, covering individual field validations and cross-model consistency checks (e.g., `primitive_type_id` linkage, `value_mapping` key validation against `PrimitiveType` constraints).
    - All 19 tests for these initial ratings framework models are currently passing.
- **HEDIS Measure Parsing (`hedis_measure_parser.py`)**:
    - Developed a Python script (`hedis_platform/utils/hedis_measure_parser.py`) to parse HEDIS measure definitions from `SPECS/info_docs/HEDIS-MY-2025-Measure-Description.txt`.
    - The script successfully parses measure names, abbreviations, descriptions, and categories.
- **HEDIS MY2025 Measure Definition Loading**:
    - Successfully parsed all 87 HEDIS MY2025 measure definitions from the source text file.
    - Generated `SPECS/info_docs/parsed_hedis_measures_my2025.json`, which contains the structured data for these 87 measures. This represents 100% completion for the initial parsing and loading of measure definitions.
- **Documentation Source File Status**:
    - The primary source for measure definitions is `SPECS/info_docs/HEDIS-MY-2025-Measure-Description.txt`.
    - The Markdown version, `SPECS/info_docs/HEDIS-MY-2025-Measure-Description.md`, currently has a pandoc conversion error and is not being used for content.
- **Framework Document Review (`ratings_framework_notes.md`)**:
    - Reviewed `SPECS/info_docs/ratings_framework_notes.md` and identified its strong potential as a base for a generalized metrics/ratings framework, applicable beyond HEDIS. Suggested areas for improvement include terminology, type expansion, and structural clarity.

## 4. Key Focus Areas & Next Steps (Aligned with Project Roadmap - Phase 1 & 2)

- **Implement Detailed Measure Logic**:
    - Begin implementing the detailed eligibility and calculation logic within the `HealthMeasureType` framework for an initial set of 2-3 key HEDIS measures, as per Phase 1 of the roadmap.
- **Develop API Layer (FastAPI)**:
    - Set up the FastAPI application structure.
    - Develop initial API endpoints for data submission, triggering calculations, and retrieving status/results.
- **Database & Data Ingestion**:
    - Select and set up a development database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
    - Define initial database schemas.
    - Develop initial data ingestion scripts for common formats (CSV, text files) and validate using Pydantic models.
- **Expand Test Coverage**:
    - Implement comprehensive unit tests for new calculation logic and API endpoints.
    - Create more extensive test datasets.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Configure CI/CD pipeline for automated builds, linting, type checking, and unit tests.
- **Generalize Ratings Framework**:
    - Based on the review of `ratings_framework_notes.md`, consider refining and promoting it to a core framework design document for broader applicability.
- **Review Ancillary Documentation**:
    - Assess `SPECS/004_TESTING_AND_VALIDATION.md` for relevance to the HEDIS project, as it currently appears to describe a different system. Plan for its update or replacement if necessary.
